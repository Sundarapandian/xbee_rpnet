Introduction
============
	The basic idea of this project is to create a mesh network of XBee devices to transmit data from non-battery powered devices to a central co-ordinator (Using XBee RF device Version 2.5). Note that 1.x version will not support this feature and so don't even think about using this software on 1.x. I'll come up with more documentation soon. Stay tuned ;-)
